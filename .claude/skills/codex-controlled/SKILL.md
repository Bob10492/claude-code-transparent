# Skill: Codex-Controlled Superpowers Orchestrator

`codex-controlled` is the control plane for transparent, checkpointed agent collaboration.

It does not replace Superpowers.
It routes, constrains, and explains Superpowers usage.

- `codex-controlled` controls: phase, scope, evidence, user understanding, checkpoints, project hygiene.
- `Superpowers` provides: planning, TDD, debugging, subagents, worktrees, verification, code review, branch finishing.

## Positioning

Use this skill when the task needs explicit boundaries, user-visible checkpoints, explanation discipline, or project hygiene checks before implementation.

This skill exists to keep strong execution methods usable without losing control.

## Core Principles

### Current truth beats historical documents

When multiple sources disagree, use this default priority:

1. Current source code and current runtime behavior.
2. Current logs, database state, metrics, dashboards, and observable artifacts.
3. Current task instructions and current repository-local docs.
4. Historical notes, PDFs, prior plans, and summaries.

Do not assume documents still match the repository.

### User understanding beats execution speed

If the user does not understand the goal, tradeoff, risk, scope boundary, or acceptance bar, pause execution-oriented work and explain first.

### Checkpoints are the phase gate

Do not silently advance to a later phase without a checkpoint when the current control level requires one.

### Facts, inference, and uncertainty stay separate

Never present inference as fact.

## Non-bypassable Rules

Superpowers skills are execution helpers, not permission systems.

They must not bypass:

1. User explicit constraints
2. Current source/runtime evidence priority
3. Project Hygiene Gate
4. Checkpoint approval
5. Scope boundaries
6. Fact / inference / uncertainty separation
7. Evidence-before-completion
8. Coach Mode when the user asks to understand

## Control Levels

Default to the lightest level that can safely preserve user understanding and project integrity.
Do not use Level 3 for every task.

### Level 0: Direct

For small conceptual Q&A or simple explanations.
No full phase workflow.

### Level 1: Light Control

For small edits, small docs, config tweaks, or narrow bug investigations.
Requires goal, boundary, minimal verification, and short checkpoint.

### Level 2: Standard Control

For normal code changes, bugfixes, and feature additions.
Requires framing, execution plan, controlled execution, verification, checkpoint.

### Level 3: Strict Control

For architecture changes, observability, metrics, ETL, dashboards, runners, scorers, gates, schemas, data cleaning, and experiment systems.
Requires full Project Hygiene Gate and, when applicable, Data / Observability Hygiene.

## Phase Model

Not every task needs every phase.
Choose the minimum phase depth that matches the control level.
Phases may be lightweight, but they must not be invisible.

| Phase | Purpose | Primary sub-skill |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 Framing | Compress the request into a bounded task | `skills/01_requirement_framing.md` |
| Phase 1 Discussion | Align on decision points and tradeoffs | `skills/02_discussion_mode.md` |
| Phase 2 Layered Explanation | Explain concepts, code, or rationale in user-fit language | `skills/03_layered_explanation.md` |
| Phase 3 Project Hygiene Gate | Check project state before implementation | `skills/04_preflight_hygiene.md` |
| Phase 4 Planning | Produce a bounded execution plan from the Spec Bundle | `skills/00_superpowers_routing.md` and `writing-plans` |
| Phase 5 Controlled Execution | Implement one approved minimal loop | `skills/05_controlled_execution.md` |
| Phase 6 Verification | Produce real evidence before any completion claim | `verification-before-completion` |
| Phase 7 Acceptance Review | Produce checkpoint review and wait for approval | `skills/06_acceptance_review.md` |
| Phase 8 Finishing | Wrap up branch/PR choices after approval | `finishing-a-development-branch` |

## Phase Transition Rules

Always state the current phase by name when moving the task forward.

Use labels in this form:

- `Phase 0 Framing`
- `Phase 1 Discussion`
- `Phase 2 Layered Explanation`
- `Phase 3 Project Hygiene Gate`
- `Phase 4 Planning`
- `Phase 5 Controlled Execution`
- `Phase 6 Verification`
- `Phase 7 Acceptance Review`
- `Phase 8 Finishing`

Rules:

1. Phases may be lightweight, but they must not be invisible.
2. If a phase is skipped or compressed, state why.
3. Do not imply a silent jump from one phase to another.
4. If the task moves from framing toward implementation, state what produced the execution contract.

### Required phase depth by level

- Level 0 usually stays in Phase 0, Phase 1, or Phase 2 only.
- Level 1 may compress Phase 0, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6, and Phase 7 into a short loop.
- Level 2 normally uses Phase 0, Phase 4, Phase 5, Phase 6, and Phase 7.
- Level 3 requires explicit Phase 3 before implementation and applies Data / Observability Hygiene when relevant.

## Project Hygiene Gate

Phase 3 is now `Project Hygiene Gate`, not a data-only preflight.

It has two layers:

1. `General Project Hygiene`
2. `Data / Observability Hygiene`

Run the second layer only when the task involves logs, metrics, ETL, dashboards, runners, scorers, gates, schemas, data cleaning, or experiments.
For Level 1 tasks, Project Hygiene may be a two-line check unless the workspace or truth source is actually unclear.

## Spec Bundle Minimum

Before `Phase 4 Planning`, ensure there is a Spec Bundle containing:

- Goal
- Constraints
- Non-goals
- Approved scope
- Acceptance bar
- Checkpoint behavior
- Hygiene status

The Spec Bundle may be assembled from Requirement Framing, Brainstorming output, Discussion decisions, and Project Hygiene results, but it must be stated as an execution contract before planning.

## Superpowers Routing Matrix

| Phase | Trigger | Superpowers skill | codex-controlled constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 Framing | New feature, architecture, UI/UX, visualization, unclear design | brainstorming | Output is only design input, not execution permission |
| Phase 4 Planning | Spec Bundle exists and user wants implementation | writing-plans | Plan must include non-goals, file boundaries, minimal loop, stop conditions |
| Phase 5 Execution | New feature or bugfix | test-driven-development | Only within approved scope |
| Phase 5 Debugging | Bug, failing test, abnormal behavior | systematic-debugging | No fix before root cause evidence |
| Phase 5 Parallel | 2+ independent subtasks | dispatching-parallel-agents | Only if tasks have no shared mutable state |
| Phase 5 Isolation | Dirty/risky workspace | using-git-worktrees | Worktree does not remove checkpoint requirements |
| Phase 5 Complex | Multi-step implementation | subagent-driven-development | Main agent remains responsible for scope and final review |
| Phase 6 Verification | Before claiming completion | verification-before-completion | No real output means no completion claim |
| Phase 7 Review | Before merge/PR or final acceptance | requesting-code-review | Review result feeds checkpoint |
| Phase 8 Finishing | After verified completion | finishing-a-development-branch | No auto-merge or cleanup without user choice |

### Supporting Superpowers mappings

| Context | Superpowers skill | codex-controlled constraint |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 5 plan-following execution | executing-plans | Execution order does not expand approved scope, file boundaries, or stop conditions |
| Phase 7 review feedback intake | receiving-code-review | Review feedback is input, not automatic permission for new changes |
| Cross-phase skill selection help | using-superpowers | Meta-guidance does not bypass control levels, hygiene gates, checkpoints, or evidence rules |

## Conflict Priority

When `codex-controlled` and Superpowers rules overlap or conflict:

1. User explicit instruction wins.
2. Safety, truthfulness, and current runtime evidence win.
3. `codex-controlled` checkpoints win.
4. Project Hygiene Gate wins before implementation.
5. Data / Observability Hygiene wins for logs, metrics, ETL, dashboard, runner, scorer, gate, schema, experiment tasks.
6. Superpowers decides methodology only inside approved execution boundaries.
7. Speed and completeness never override user understanding.

## Routing Rules

- Use `skills/01_requirement_framing.md` to compress goals, boundaries, non-goals, and control level.
- Use `brainstorming` only for design exploration. Its output must flow back into the Spec Bundle before planning or execution.
- `using-superpowers` may recommend a skill, but `codex-controlled` decides whether the recommendation is allowed in the current phase.
- If the user expresses confusion, disagreement, or asks why, suspend execution-oriented Superpowers skills and use `skills/02_discussion_mode.md` or `skills/03_layered_explanation.md`.
- Use `skills/04_preflight_hygiene.md` before implementation when project state, structure, generated artifacts, truth sources, or blast radius may be unclear.
- Use `skills/05_controlled_execution.md` to define approved scope, allowed files, forbidden files, minimum closed loop, stop conditions, and evidence requirements.
- Use `verification-before-completion` before any completion claim.
- Use `skills/06_acceptance_review.md` to produce the checkpoint card. No checkpoint means the task is not complete.
- Use `skills/07_coach_mode.md` whenever the user wants to understand commands, verification, review logic, or why a specific Superpowers skill was selected.
